username = input(9) # with the input() function you can ask userinput, which can be filled in in the terminal
print(type(username)) #Datatype of the output is always a string
                        #print() function is an in built function, 
                        #by using this function and then running the code, you can see the output in the terminal


# Exercise 2:
# Create a new script.
# Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
# Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
